Great detail write-up on newer AI-powered search engines and traditional search engines approach, called lexical (or sparse) retrieval, which relies upon an inverted index data structure (search tools like Elastic use this traditional approach). Very nice and easy read.

I myself played around with building one of these AI-powered search capability using Python, Chroma (Vector DB) & Cross-Encoder ranking AI model. With all of these core components available in the open source, it is really amazing how easy it is to build such complex capability pretty quickly in no time ([**sample code example here**](/RAG/RAGLab4.py).
