# Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge graphs are large networks of entities representing real-world objects, like people and organizations, and abstract concepts, like professions and topics, and their semantic relations and attributes. Knowledge graphs emphasize on defining the semantic relations between entities, which is central to providing humans and machines with context and means for automated reasoning. 

What makes a knowledge graph a unique and powerful data solution is the semantic (data) model, or ontology, that is part of it. An ontology enriches data within a knowledge graph with context and meaning that humans and computers can interpret. It's like a powerful lens that grants you a holistic, bird's eye view of your data, revealing intricate hierarchies, precise definitions and crucial context. It unlocks unparalleled access to the deepest layers of interpretation, empowering you to grasp the essence and true meaning of your data. 

A knowledge graph is not simply a graph structure that captures interlinked data. Ontology is a very key ingradient of a Knowledge Graph that adds contextual richness and promotes comprehensive analysis and knowledge creation and sharing.
