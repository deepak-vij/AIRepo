# Time-Series Forecasting
[Google’s recent work on TimesFM, a foundational model for time-series forecasting, could be a step in this direction](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7159895516770643968/)<br>
Great to see deep-learning models addressing the needs for time-series forecasting needs – encoder-decoders with attention, transformers, and of course, temporal graph neural networks (GNNs).

Especially, I am intrigued by the temporal GNNs capability of capturing inter-series or spatial dependencies, well-suited for spatial-temporal analysis. While, on the other hand, an Encoder-Decoder or Transformer based models handling temporal dependencies.
